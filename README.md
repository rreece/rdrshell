Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------

First, clone this package into your home directory as ".rdrshell":

    git clone https://github.com/rreece/rdrshell.git .rdrshell

Then run the install script, that simply copies the dotfiles into your $HOME:

    cd .rdrshell
    source install.sh

Then you can add whatever plugins or personal scripts you want to the .rdrshell/init/
directory and they will be sourced automatically in your next bash shell.
